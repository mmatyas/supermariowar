#Stages
#Map,Mode,Goal,Points,Bonus,Name,End World, then mode settings (see sample tour file for details)
#Need to support other types of stop locations like bonuses, wheel spins, mini games (maybe)
#Need to support flagging each stop as a potential world end
#Need to support awarding players with a specific or random or none powerup at end of each level (probably in a dropped treasure box)
